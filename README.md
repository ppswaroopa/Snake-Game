# Snake Game

This is the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.


## Scope & Implementations

I set out to add more features and make the game interesting.
1. Add <b>Boosts & Penalties</b> to add dynamism.
2. Add Time based challenges.
3. Add game music.
4. Make all game features accessible inside the window.

I have successfully implemented the 1st feature. Rest of the features will be implemented later.

### Boosts and Penalties
In the game Green blocks are food, they grow the length of the snake and also increase speed of movement. Brown block is the Morgue, which when passed over will kill the snake and the game will end. Yellow blocks give a chance to decrease speed and reduce length while still maintaining the score. As the snake keeps eating the food the speed will be difficult to manage so the player can use this as a way to keep them in the game. I also wanted to make them appear only after certain turns, but it broke my game. Will try again.
